The MCP specification [requires OAuth 2.1 and other RFCs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) to be implemented for authorization. MCP Auth aims to connect your MCP server to **any** compatible OAuth 2 or OpenID Connect provider, without spending hours on lengthy implementations.
