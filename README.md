The MCP spec [requires OAuth 2.1 and other RFCs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) for auth. Instead of spending weeks on them, use MCP Auth to connect to an trusted provider with a few lines of code.

## Get started

### Is my provider supported?

Check out the [MCP-compatible providers](https://mcp-auth.dev/docs/provider-list) to see which providers are supported. It also includes a tool for real-time checking of provider compatibility.

### Installation

```bash
npm install mcp-auth
```

Or use your package manager of choice, such as `pnpm` or `yarn`.

See [the documentation](https://mcp-auth.dev/docs/get-started) for the full guide.
